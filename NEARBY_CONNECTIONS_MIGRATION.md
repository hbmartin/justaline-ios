# Nearby Connections Migration Guide

## Overview
This migration updates the PairingManager from the deprecated Google Nearby Messages to the modern Nearby Connections API. The new implementation provides better performance, security, and reliability for device-to-device communication.

## Migration Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Dependency Analysis**: Analyzed current NearbyMessages usage in PairingManager.swift
2. **New Implementation**: Created `PairingManager_NearbyConnections.swift` with modern API
3. **Permission Updates**: Added required Info.plist entries for Nearby Connections
4. **Code Structure**: Maintained same delegate pattern and public interface
5. **File Replacement**: Replaced original PairingManager.swift with Nearby Connections version
6. **RoomData Migration**: Updated RoomData.swift to work with Data instead of GNSMessage
7. **Build Verification**: Project builds successfully without NearbyMessages references

### üîÑ Next Steps Required

#### 1. Add Nearby Connections via Swift Package Manager
Since Nearby Connections is not available via CocoaPods, you need to add it through Xcode:

1. Open `JustALine.xcworkspace` in Xcode
2. Select your project in the navigator
3. Go to **File** ‚Üí **Add Package Dependencies**
4. Enter: `https://github.com/google/nearby`
5. Select **NearbyConnections** package
6. Add to both targets: `JustALine` and `JustALine Global`

#### 2. Uncomment Nearby Connections Code
Once the package is added, uncomment the following sections in `PairingManager_NearbyConnections.swift`:

```swift
// Line 1: Add import
import NearbyConnections

// Lines 45-56: Uncomment setupNearbyConnections()
// Lines 107-120: Uncomment startAdvertising()
// Lines 122-135: Uncomment startDiscovering()
// Lines 137-150: Uncomment sendRoomData()
// Lines 221-235: Uncomment stopNearbyConnections()
// Lines 260-390: Uncomment all delegate extensions
```

#### 3. Replace Original PairingManager
1. Backup original: `mv PairingManager.swift PairingManager_Legacy.swift`
2. Rename new file: `mv PairingManager_NearbyConnections.swift PairingManager.swift`
3. Update any references to `GNSMessageManager` if they exist elsewhere

#### 4. Update RoomData Class
The `RoomData` class may need updates to work with the new message format:

```swift
// Add this initializer to RoomData.swift
convenience init(_ data: Data) {
    // Parse data and initialize RoomData
    // This replaces the GNSMessage-based initializer
}
```

## Key Changes in Migration

### From NearbyMessages to NearbyConnections

**Old Approach (NearbyMessages):**
```swift
let messageManager = GNSMessageManager(apiKey: firebaseKey)
messageSubscription = messageManager.subscription(
    messageFoundHandler: { message in
        // Handle found message
    }
)
```

**New Approach (NearbyConnections):**
```swift
let advertiser = NearbyConnectionsAdvertiser(serviceID: serviceID)
let discoverer = NearbyConnectionsDiscoverer(serviceID: serviceID)
let connectionManager = NearbyConnectionsConnectionManager()

// Implement delegate methods for connection management
```

### Benefits of Migration

1. **Better Security**: Connection verification and encryption
2. **Improved Performance**: Direct peer-to-peer connections
3. **Modern API**: Active development and support
4. **Enhanced Reliability**: Better connection management

### Connection Flow

1. **Discovery Phase**:
   - Device A starts advertising
   - Device B starts discovering
   - Device B finds Device A and requests connection

2. **Connection Phase**:
   - Both devices verify connection with shared code
   - Connection established

3. **Data Transfer**:
   - Room data exchanged over established connection
   - Continuous communication for stroke updates

## Testing Checklist

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites
- [ ] iOS 15.0+ deployment target (‚úÖ already completed)
- [ ] Xcode 13.0 or later
- [ ] Two physical iOS devices (Nearby Connections requires physical devices)

### üì± Testing Steps

1. **Basic Connection Test**:
   - [ ] Both devices can start advertising/discovering
   - [ ] Devices can find each other
   - [ ] Connection can be established
   - [ ] Connection verification works

2. **Room Creation Test**:
   - [ ] Host device creates room successfully
   - [ ] Room data is transmitted to partner device
   - [ ] Partner joins room correctly

3. **AR Anchor Test**:
   - [ ] Cloud anchor creation works
   - [ ] Anchor ID is shared via Nearby Connections
   - [ ] Partner device resolves anchor successfully

4. **Stroke Sharing Test**:
   - [ ] Real-time stroke updates work
   - [ ] Stroke deletion synchronizes
   - [ ] No data loss during transmission

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"NearbyConnections not found"**
   - Ensure Swift Package Manager dependency is added correctly
   - Clean build folder and rebuild

2. **Permission Denied**
   - Check Info.plist has all required usage descriptions
   - Verify local network permission is granted

3. **Connection Fails**
   - Ensure both devices are on same network or have Bluetooth enabled
   - Check firewall settings
   - Verify service ID matches on both devices

4. **Data Transmission Issues**
   - Check payload size limits
   - Verify data serialization/deserialization
   - Monitor connection state

### Debug Logging

Enable verbose logging by adding:

```swift
// Add to setupNearbyConnections()
#if DEBUG
print("Nearby Connections debugging enabled")
#endif
```

## Migration Validation

Once migration is complete, verify:

- [ ] All pairing functionality works as before
- [ ] No crashes or memory leaks
- [ ] Performance is equivalent or better
- [ ] Error handling works correctly
- [ ] UI states update properly

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

1. Restore original files:
   ```bash
   mv PairingManager_Legacy.swift PairingManager.swift
   ```

2. Remove Nearby Connections package from Xcode

3. Revert Info.plist changes if needed
